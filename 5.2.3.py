#Recall in the lesson on sorts that we had you complete the
#Bubble and Selection sort, and we showed you Merge sort.
#We didn't show any of insertion sort, and I bet you can
#guess why.
#
#Implement insertion sort below.
#
#Name your function 'insertion'. insertion should take as
#input a list, and return as output a sorted list. Note that
#even though technically a sorting method does not have to
#return the sorted list, yours should.
#
#If you're stuck on where to start, or having trouble
#visualizing or understanding how exactly insertion sort
#works, check out this website - https://visualgo.net/sorting
#It provides a visual representation of all of the sorting
#algorithms as well as pseudocode you can base your own code
#off of.


#Write your code here!

# Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort
  
# Function to do insertion sort
def insertion(arr):
  
    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
  
        key = arr[i]
  
        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
        # greater than key, to one position ahead
        # of their current position
        j = i-1
        while j >=0 and key < arr[j] :
                arr[j+1] = arr[j]
                j -= 1
        arr[j+1] = key
    return(arr)
  
# Driver code to test above
#arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
#insertionSort(arr)
#print ("Sorted array is:")
#for i in range(len(arr)):
#    print ("%d" %arr[i])

#The code below will test your function. If your function
#works, it will print: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
print(insertion([5, 1, 3, 2, 4]))
