#The Fibonacci sequence is a number sequence where each
#number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first
#two numbers are defined as 0 and 1, so the third number is
#1 (0 + 1 = 1), the fourth number is 2 (1 + 1 = 2), the
#fifth number is 3 (1 + 2 = 3), the sixth number is 5
#(2 + 3 = 5), and so on.
#
#Below we've started a class called FibSeq. At any time,
#FibSeq holds two values from the Fibonacci sequence:
#back1 and back2.
#
#Create a new method inside FibSeq called next_number. The
#next_number method should:
#
# - Calculate and return the next number in the sequence,
#   based on the previous 2.
# - Update back2 with the former value of back1, and update
#   back1 with the new next item in the sequence.
#
#This means that consecutive calls to next_number should
#yield each consecutive number from the Fibonacci sequence.
#Calling next_number 5 times would print 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.
